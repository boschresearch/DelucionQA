To do this, you need to cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.

Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine. This means that your vehicle's OBD II system is not ready and you should not proceed to the I/M station. The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.
