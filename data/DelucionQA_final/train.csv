Know your vehicle: Before you hit the trails, make sure you know your vehicle's capabilities and limitations. This will help you avoid getting stuck or damaging your vehicle. 2. Check your tires: Make sure your tires are properly inflated and have good tread. Consider using off-road tires if you plan on doing a lot of off-roading. 3. Use 4-wheel drive: If your vehicle has 4-wheel drive, use it when off-roading. This will give you better traction and control. 4. Go slow: Off-roading is not a race. Take your time and go slow to avoid getting stuck or damaging your vehicle. 5. Use low gear: When driving on steep inclines or declines, use low gear to maintain control and avoid overheating your brakes. 6. Avoid sudden movements: Sudden movements can cause your vehicle to lose traction and get stuck. Make smooth and deliberate movements. 7.

Use Remote Start: If your vehicle has a remote start feature, use it to start the engine before you get in the car. This will allow the engine to warm up and the front and rear defrost to turn on automatically. 2. Use the Comfort Menu: If your vehicle has a heated steering wheel and driver heated seat feature, make sure it is programmed in the Comfort menu screen within Uconnect Settings. This will allow the heated steering wheel and driver heated seat to turn on automatically when you use the remote start feature. 3. Drain the Fuel/Water Separator: Diesel fuel is seldom completely free of water, so to prevent fuel system trouble, drain the accumulated water from the fuel/water separator using the fuel/water separator drain provided on the fuel filter housing. 4. Use Good Quality Fuel: If you buy good quality fuel and follow the listed cold weather recommendations, fuel conditioners should not be required in your vehicle. If available in your area, a high cetane “premium” diesel fuel may offer improved cold-starting and warm-up performance. 5. Avoid Full Throttle Operation: Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.
